/**
 * \brief A Quad instance is a special tree. Instances are geographically defined and divided into four children. Each
 * Quad is a container. Leaf quads, those with no children, contain entities, e.g., Edges. This Quad implementation uses
 * two boundary definitions. One is a fuzzy boundary that is used to determine which entities are contained within a
 * quad. The actual boundary is used to retrieve entities. A Quad tree is a more efficient data structure to use for
 * searching through a geographical space since search is logarithmic in the number of levels.  The entities within a
 * leaf Quad must still be searched linearly.
